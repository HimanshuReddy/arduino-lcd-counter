# arduino-lcd-counter

This project uses an arduino to read the values of two potentiometers to display a number on a LCD screen, ranging from 0-255.
One potenitometer increments the counter by multiples of 1, and the other by multiples of 16. This is to add finer control
in selecting the value to be displayed.
